This is Canonical.
==================

-adj reduced to the simplest and most significant form possible without loss of generality.

Since I use these files when I'm programming pretty much anything, I would say that they are canonical.

How to Install
--------------

Just clone this project.

How to Use
----------

There are two scripts, `runMe.sh` and `updateSrc.sh`.

* `runMe.sh` will make backups of .vimrc, .bashrc, .vim and copy over some better stuff.
* `updateSrc.sh` will update the default files with your own.
